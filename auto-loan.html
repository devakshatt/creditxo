                        <p>
                            A loan that is used to purchase a vehicle is known as an automobile or auto loan. The
                            vehicle purchased with the loan money is held by the lender as collateral until the entire
                            loan amount with interest has been paid. This is known as hypothecation to the bank or
                            finance company. In case the customer defaults on the loan, the lender holds the
                            hypothecated vehicle to recover their dues. On repayment of the full amount, the ownership
                            documents are changed to reflect complete ownership by the customer.
                        </p>
